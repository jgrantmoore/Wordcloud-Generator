This app takes a user inputted url and scrapes the website for visible text (using api-ninjas
webscraper api) and takes the first 200 words of that text and makes a word cloud out of it (using
quickchart's word cloud api) Github: https://github.com/jgrantmoore/cs1302-api

## Part 2: New

> What is something new and/or exciting that you learned from working
> on this project?

While I didn't end up having to use it, I leaned about POST requests and how you can pass along
a JSON configuration file with a Http request

## Part 3: Retrospect

> If you could start the project over from scratch, what do
> you think might do differently and why?

I think I would have chosen different api's to link together/gone with a different idea. This one
was rather easy but it was fun nevertheless!
